### Demo Content ###

Optional: You can download a demo content file [here](http://graphpaperpress-demo-content.s3.amazonaws.com/shibui.xml) that you can import in Tools > Import.

### Theme Customizer ###

With the Theme Customizer, you can set your title and tagline, upload a logo, assign your menus, and choose your desired Google Fonts for your site. You can also add custom CSS to make changes quickly and preview those changes. Theme Customizer is the main highlight of this theme. Most of the Theme Options such as homepage section options are baked into the Theme Customizer.


### Setting up the Homepage ###

This theme can have many different homepage appearances depending on what you need. That is why we are calling it a flexible and customizable theme. If you want to set up homepage as seen in the demo, please create a Page and assign it a Homepage page template. Then, go to Settings -> Reading menu and assign a Static Front page with the name of the page you just created. This should enable you to create a page very much like the [theme demo](http://demo.graphpaperpress.com/shibui/).


### Required Plugins ###

This theme integrates seamlessly with JetPack's Custom Content Type (Portfolio) Posts. So if you are thinking of creating a portfolio site with this theme, please make sure you have JetPack installed and the Portfolio Custom Post Type activated. Once you start creating Portfolio posts, you should be able to see the grid of images (featured images) on the homepage.


### Slideshows ###

Of many homepage features, Slideshow is one. Please go to Theme Customizer from Appearance -> Customizer menu and click Slideshow. You can upload your images and they should appear on the preview as slideshows. You can also set other options of the slideshow. Slideshows appears on the top of the page.


### Welcome Message ###

A welcome Message appears right after the site title and menu. You can set this from the customizer.


### Portfolio ###

As mentioned, please install and activate JetPack and its Custom Content Types (Portfolio). You can start adding your posts if you haven't yet and the portfolio section will appear on the static home page we set earlier. You can use the "portfolio" link in the menu as such as [this](http://demo.graphpaperpress.com/shibui/portfolio/) to point to your Portfolio archive.


### Blog ###

By default, all the Posts will appear as Blog. If you set the Static Front Page in Settings -> Reading option to Latest Posts, your website will appear as a normal Blog site. If you have a Static Front Page set to the Homepage Template, then these posts will appear as "Blog" below the Portfolio Section.


### Call To Action Widget ###

Additionally, there is a full width one-column Call to Action widget for promotion purposes. You can add this widget via Appearance -> Widgets menu.


### Widgets ###

This theme supports widgets in the homepage second column (sidebar) and footer. For more detail about adding widgets to your site, please read [Adding Widgets](http://graphpaperpress.com/support/using-widgets/).

1. Go to Appearance > Menus.
2. Create a new menu item by clicking the + tab.

### Social Media Icons/Menu ###

You can add social media icons to the Social menu. Simply add your social profile URL and the icons will appear automatically. Social Menu appears at the bottom of the site.


### Featured Images ###

This theme relies heavily on Featured Images. All featured images appear on the home and archive pages. On single entry pages, the Featured Image will be set as the header image. If your post is missing a Featured Image, it will be left blank.

Choose the image you want to set as a featured image for this post and click the *Set as Featured Image* button. For best results, use images that are at least 960 pixels wide.
